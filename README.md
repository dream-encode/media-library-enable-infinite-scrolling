A small plugin to re-enable infinite scrolling in the Media Library after WordPress 5.7 is released.

## Description

After WordPress 5.7 is released, infinite scrolling will be removed by default from the Media Library.  See Trac ticket [50105](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50105) for the releated changeset and ticket [40330](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40330) for the historical conterxt behind the decision.

This plugin, for the short term, is a global re-enabling of infinite scrolling in the Media Library for all users.

A potential future enhancement is to have a per-user setting, letting individual users decide what's best for them.
